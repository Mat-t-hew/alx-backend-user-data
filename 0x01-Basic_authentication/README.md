# 0x01. Basic authentication

## Background Context

In this project, you will learn what the authentication process means and implement a  **Basic Authentication**  on a simple API.

In the industry, you should  **not**  implement your own Basic authentication system and use a module or framework that doing it for you (like in Python-Flask:  [Flask-HTTPAuth](https://intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/XvXTZnSvVYaLaWtAWcTkYQ "Flask-HTTPAuth")). Here, for the learning purpose, we will walk through each step of this mechanism to understand it by doing.
